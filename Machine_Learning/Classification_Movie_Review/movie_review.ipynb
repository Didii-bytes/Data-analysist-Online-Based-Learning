    "We will use the IMDB dataset, which consists of 50,000 highly polarized reviews collected from the Internet Movie Database. The dataset is split into 25,000 training samples and 25,000 test samples, with 50% negative reviews and 50% positive reviews in each set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we split the data into training and test sets? Because you should never train and test a machine learning model on the same data! Just because a model performs well on the training data does not mean it will perform well on data it has never seen before. What really matters is the model’s performance on new data (in fact, since we already know the labels of the training data, there would be no point in building a model just to predict them).\n",

    "For example, a model could simply memorize the mapping between the training samples and their targets. Such a model would be useless for predicting targets on new data. We will explore this issue in more detail in the next chapter"
